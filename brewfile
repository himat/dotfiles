# TODO: add the rest
# Note, gnu coreutils commands are all prefixed with a 'g' like 'gls' for the GNU ls command. If you want to use the commands with the normal names and overwrite the mac ones, then add gnubin to your PATH. Run `brew info coreutils` for the path.
# Same thing for the other GNU ones: coreutils, findutils, gnu-tar, gnu-sed, grep
# Add them to your ~/.shellrc.extra
