###### Install node

# First install nvm
# NOTE: this installs a version that might be older compared to when you're installing this now
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.1/install.sh | bash

# Maybe-TODO: might need to source bashrc after installing nvm so that it's available in the next line

# Install latest node LTS version
nvm install --lts
